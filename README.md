# true_RMS_voltmeter_PIC32MX
AC voltmeter (true RMS) to measure 120VAC with a PIC32 microcontroller.

Project Description
This project features an alternating current (AC) voltmeter capable of measuring up to Â±300V peak and a highly accurate frequency meter.

Key Features:
TRUE RMS Measurement: The device computes precise mathematical calculations on the analyzed signal to deliver an accurate true RMS value.
Frequency Meter: Accurately measures the frequency of the input AC signal, making it versatile for various applications.
Self-Powered Design: No external power source is required. The circuit is powered directly from the analyzed signal itself.

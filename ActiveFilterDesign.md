I have designed the second order filter with MCHP's FilterLab software, for a frequency of 1000 Hz.

I'm going to use 9.3k and 13k resistors respectively for R11 and R12, I don't think it will affect much for the designed frequency.

The idea of ​​the filter is to eliminate any high frequency noise coming from the mains.
